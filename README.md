# Book-Detection-YOLOv5-model
# idea:
This projects aims to combine Books data with powerful Computer Visuon tools to enable detecting books from real time captured data. ðŸ“š

# project steps:
I started by downloading my version of (books detection dataset) from Roboflow.com
then trained the model in Kaggle.com -notebook: train.ipynb- using my dataset and the -data.yaml- file included.
downloaded the model file -best.pt- then tested it at -inference.ipynb-

# Future improvments: !
* train a model to identify books titles.
* gather more customized dataset.
